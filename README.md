This is Python script to generate artificial data for two scenarios of smart homes. Specifically, it is to simulate the distribution of the duration of inhabitants to perform activities of "Toileting" and "Breakfast".
The main objective of this data is to generate data that is a mixture of two subactivities, for example ("Toileting" is a combination of "use toilet" and then "wash hands"), therefore to validate the method of proposed gamma convolution model.
